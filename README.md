# Traffic-Light-Controller
Final Project for ECE 112 - by Nicholas Graham and Jenna Becerra

We designed a traffic light controller to handle a four way traffic stop. It has pedestrian crossing signals as well as the standard stoplights. There were two different modes, one that was entirly based off of timing the other that only changes when a car arrives at the intersection.
